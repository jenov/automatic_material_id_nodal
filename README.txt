This script is used to create a material id node-based. I have used the idea for the compositing scheme that made rio. This script has helped me to learn some more programming with nodes in blender. Original source nodes of the composition: http://www.yafaray.org/community/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=4630&start=15
This script create a full copy scene.

Usage:

1 Open the text editor.

2 In the texteditor: press button "new" and copy the script inside, or open .py script. And run it.

3 Press f12 to pull a render and allocate the id.

Usually you're all set for use!.

Sorry for my bad English.
Enjoy!
